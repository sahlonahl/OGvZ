NOTE: This is an add-on. You will require the OGvZ data pack to play the game.
IMPORTANT: You need to place this add-on data pack AFTER the OGvZ data pack. If you just drag and drop the 2 data packs into the datapack folder, they will put themselves in the correct order automatically (data packs are loaded in alphabetical order).
NOTE: Modifies only files inside the minecraft namespace.

CHANGELOG:
- All planks now always drop themselves, even for zombie players.
- Stone and Cobblestone drop Cobblestone for zombie players too.
- Deepslate and Cobblestone Deepslate drop Cobbled Deepslate for zombie players too.
- Wooden and Stone tools can now be crafted.
- Reinforced Bricks (blue bricks) now require at least an Iron Pickaxe to mine quickly. A wooden pickaxe will only mine them slightly faster than by hand.
