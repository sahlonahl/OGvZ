NOTE: This is an add-on. You will require the OGvZ data pack to play the game.
IMPORTANT: You need to place this add-on data pack AFTER the OGvZ data pack.
NOTE: Modifies only files inside the minecraft namespace.

CHANGELOG:
- All planks now always drop themselves, even for zombie players.
- Wooden tools can now be crafted.
- Reinforced Bricks (blue bricks) now require at least an Iron Pickaxe to mine quickly. A wooden pickaxe will only mine them slightly faster than by hand.
- Mining Gold Blocks with any pickaxe now takes same amount of time as mining the block by hand.
