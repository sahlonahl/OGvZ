# Pull Requests
When creating full requests, ensure that your add-ons or fixes are well documented so they can be properly implemented.  Please **_TEST_** your code locally before sending a request.  Your `.mcfunction` files should follow the same header format as the ones in the rest of the datapack.  In the comments, indicate which lines you added in `tick.mcfunction` to reference your add-ons, as applicable.

# Server environment
OGvZ has been developed avoiding the use of third party server plugins to make it as drag and drop as possible as well as maintaining flexibility in running on a vanilla minecraft server, but in practice runs on PaperMC. The server uses several quality of life plugins, none of which should effect the operation of the datapack. 

The Minecraft version targeted is usually the latest version that PaperMC+Plugins support, with some buffer time to avoid potentially unstable server builds.

The server is currently on `1.19.4`
